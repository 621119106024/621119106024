                <p> Bhogi Pongal marks the beginning of the festivities. It’s a day dedicated to cleaning and getting
                    rid of old things. People gather and discard unused items, symbolising the discarding of the old to
                    make way for the new. Bonfires are lit, and there is a sense of renewal in the air as households
                    prepare for the days of celebration ahead.</p>
